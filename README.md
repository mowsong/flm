Collections of CMSIS flash loaders for OpenOCD

This repository currently contains the compiled binary of the CMSIS flash loaders (FLM) from several MCU vendors.

The FLMs are to be used with the OpenOCD generic cmsis flash driver, which was first developed by the Cypress fork.

By using the generic cmsis flash driver, it is easier to add flash programming support for the new device without having to compile the OpenOCD.
